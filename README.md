## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great social network platform like facebook, twitter, instagram out there but we didn't find one that really suit our needs

Here's why:

* Our privacy matters: Existing social network platforms may not fully meet your privacy requirements. With our platform, you have control over your data and can store it securely on your own server.
* Tailored to our needs: We understand that one size does not fit all. Our platform allows you to customize your social network according to your specific requirements and preferences. If your Pc does not have enough memory to run the server, you can rent a server from a hosting provider such as Azure.
* We want to learn: We want to learn about how to build a social network platform
so we created this project to help us and other people to create their own social network platform that suit their needs.

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So We'll be adding more features in the near future. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this project ! :smile:
